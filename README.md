# JQuery_Snake

A reproduction of the classic and timeless game of Snake.  Currently, the repo must be downloaded and then the index html file used to access the game, but a Heroku link is forthcoming. 

## Controls

Use the arrow keys to move the Snake.
<br>
Pause the game using the spacebar.

## High Scores

As this project is still entirely in the repository, there is no mechanism for storing high-scores across sessions, but without refreshes, high-scores will appear and sort themselves dynamically across lives.

## Enjoy!
